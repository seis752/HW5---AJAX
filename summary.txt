I have not linked HW5 and HW4 as some features of HW4 have not been finalized and also the databases would have to be changed.
I instead created a new table and called it user(not users as in HW4).
Going to index will redirect you to login if you have not yet signed it.
Signing in will take you to index which will then redirect you to the search page(since index doesn't have much) and you could do two types of searches there.
I recommend searching for "lael" as the images will be displayed for users found.
